  "summary": "Diff implements a portal-based, top-layer render for music controls and adds diagnostics/fallback UI for missing provider context. No clear missing requirements from REQ-6/7/8 are evident in the provided diff summary, but there are some additional background-music behavior changes that were not explicitly requested.",

    {
      "description": "Added persistence of music settings (volume/mute) to localStorage.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on controls visibility/stacking and lightweight diagnostics; persisting settings is a new behavior not requested and may be considered a new music feature beyond fixing visibility.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/music/BackgroundMusicProvider.tsx"
      ]

    {
      "description": "Added auto-advance behavior to play the next track automatically on audio 'ended' event, including attempts to auto-play the next track.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly states non-goal: do not add new music features; auto-advance/autoplay behavior is not part of visibility/diagnostics requirements.",

    {
      "description": "Added user-facing toast error notifications for audio load/play failures.",
      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-6/7/8; diagnostics requested were specifically a test id and a console warning for missing provider/context.",
